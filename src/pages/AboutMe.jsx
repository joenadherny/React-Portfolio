        My name is Joe Nadherny and I have just started my career path into coding. Below are some of the projects I have worked on over the past months in my Full Stack Web Development bootcamp I am finishing up.
        Besides coding, I am into biking and snowboarding all around Utah. I am hoping that through more practice and work I will be able to land a coding job!
